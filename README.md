Derelict: a graphical open source adventure
==========
In this adventure, you're a space waste collector tasked with a not-so-noble of scraping a derelict space station and blowing it out of the skies. Fail and you will either lose your scrapper license (and ship) or maybe even die!

As part of the perks of the job, you get the chance to catch a glimpse into the lives and loves of the old crew - what if you uncover the clues to solve a mistery?
